-> A Software Development Life Cycle is essentially a series of steps, or phases, that
provide a model for the development and lifecycle management of an application or piece
of software.

->Implementation 		     -Construct a Solution In Software
->Testing 			     -Validate the solution against the requirements
->Maintenance 			     -Repair defects and adapt the solution to the new requirements
